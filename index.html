        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am an IT professional with over 4.5 years of experience pursuing a
          career in web development. I have discovered my passion for coding and
          web development while working on a project which required me to learn
          Powershell scripting language to complete it. I have then discovered
          the <span>magic</span> of web development after accidentally stumbling
          across a showcase video of someone that has built their internal site
          for home use and controlled all his smart devices. The ability to
          create a custom site and to be able to connect to various smart
          devices has fired my passion even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work and coding, I enjoy playing and watching football,
          watching UFC, hanging out with friends and family, light gaming
          sessions and keeping up to date with a few tech and sports YouTube
          channels that I find inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          On rare occasions I take on <span>mini-projects</span>, such as
          replacing old iPhone's battery, disassembling and reassembling old
          laptops and tinkering with electronic devices.
