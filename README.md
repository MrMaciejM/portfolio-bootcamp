# Personal Portfolio - Challenge 02

## Description

The second challenge of the bootcamp was to design and create a personal portfolio, following certain layout and requirements.

Because this was a personal portfolio challenge, there were no specific or strict design ideas, however, there were certain acceptance criteria to ensure I build the portfolio correctly.

For example, showcasing of a few images of my projects (or placeholders) laid out on the page and wrapped in a link that would lead to projects, including 'About Me' section, and ensuring clickable nav elements work, just to name a few.

Please note that this is **the first iteration** of my personal portfolio and is subject to change at any time during and/or after the 16-week bootcamp. The image below of the design is the first idea/iteration.

## Design

When designing my portfolio, I have had few very important things in mind, but the foremost was ease of use and finding information/projects quickly.

I drew inspiration for this design from the Super Mario game - particularly a specific object - the tube from where Mario can emerge. See example below.

But instead of Mario, you'd see a card with my profile picture on it - with added CSS that when you hover over it - or click on a mobile device - green light would emerge around it.

Admittedly, the design is very simple as of now, however, in my opinion, the information is presented clearly, the site is fully responsive, all links work and the colors used make it easy to read.
